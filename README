#+TITLE: WordNet Gloss Corpus

This is a continuation of the project originally developed at
Princeton, whose original files can be found [[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/glosstag.shtml][this link]] or in the
[[https://github.com/own-pt/glosstag/tree/princeton][princeton branch]] of this repository.

See the [[https://github.com/own-pt/glosstag/releases][releases page]] for the official releases.

* What

This repository hosts a [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1075742][semantic concordance]] -- a textual corpus (the
WordNet glosses) and a lexicon (WordNet) where every content word in
the corpus is linked to its sense(s) in the lexicon.

* Why

There are several corpora with WordNet sense annotations (the SemCor,
the senseval datases), but only by sense-tagging the WordNet itself
can we guarantee that its definitional completeness -- the property
that all of its definitions only use words which are already defined
by WordNet.

* How

We are annotating the corpus using [[http://github.com/own-pt/sensetion.el/][this tool]]. It depends on the gloss
corpus in the format available in this repository. Details about the
format itself can be found in the [[https://github.com/own-pt/sensetion.el/][tool's repository]].
